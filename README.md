# Odin recipes project
This is the first hands on project in The Odin Project. The objective of the project was to apply the previous lessons about HTML structure tags and elements as well as file structure and how to work with git. In particular:
1. HTML boiler plate.
2. HTML tags and elements:
    1. !DOCTYPE
    2. html
    3. head
    4. body
    5. meta
    6. title
    7. h1, p, a, img etc.
3. Use terminal for creation/manipulation of directories and files as well as for git commands.
4. Use git and GitHub for version control and to store the project in a repository.

One additional task is to deploy the website from GitHub.

## Update
Added a stylesheet to all pages as well as some styles. All content is now contained so that the line length is not to long for comfortable reading.
All content is now in the middle of the browser window as well. Images are responsive, too.

Important note, make sure you have a meta viewport tag set up correctly if you want the page to be responsive on mobile devices.
