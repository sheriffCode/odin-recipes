# Odin recipes project
This is the first hands on project in The Odin Project. The objective of the project was to apply the previous lessons about HTML structure tags and elements as well as file structure and how to work with git. In particular:
1. HTML boiler plate.
2. HTML tags and elements:
    1. !DOCTYPE
    2. html
    3. head
    4. body
    5. meta
    6. title
    7. h1, p, a, img etc.
3. Use terminal for creation/manipulation of directories and files as well as for git commands.
4. Use git and GitHub for version control and to store the project in a repository.

One additional task is to deploy the website from GitHub.
